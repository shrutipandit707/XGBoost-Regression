# House Price Prediction System using XGBoost Regression
> In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using XGBoost Regression techniques. We will be understanding and solving a House Price Prediction problem in Real Estate Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like House Price Prediction Problem.The problem statement that we will be working on is to predict the house sales in a particular location and understand which factors are responsible for higher property value.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.

We will be using XGBoost Regression techniques techniques for House Price Prediction System.

- What is the background of your project?

In this case study, we are attempting to solve a real world business problem using XGBoost Regression techniques. We will be understanding and solving a House Price Prediction problem in Real Estate Domain.We will be checking how data can be used effectively to solve business problems like House Price Prediction Problem.The problem statement that we will be working on is to predict the house sales in a particular location and understand which factors are responsible for higher property value.


- Business Problem Statement:

House price prediction is an important concept in the real estate industry. Thus, many researchers from different Ô¨Åelds are interested in developing a regression model for the house price to obtain an accurate prediction and explore the factors affecting the house price. In this study, we aim to develop an accurate regression model using algorithm and explain the type of information which has an impact on the house price. For this purpose, we use the Ames House Price dataset being available on Kaggle.

- What is the dataset that is being used?

In this dataset we have to predict the sales price of houses in King County, Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. Before doing anything we should first know about the dataset what it contains what are its features and what is the structure of data.

The dataset cantains 20 house features plus the price, along with 21613 observations.

## Conclusions
- We have applied XGBoost Regression techniques for House Price Prediction Problem.We achieved acuuracy of 83% with this algorithm.

Further we can also perform model optimization by using GridSearch to find the appropriate parameters to increase the accuracy by fine tuning hyperparameters.

Apart from that, your valuable suggestions for further improvement and optimization are always welcome from my side do comment !!
